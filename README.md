## Trimmed action recognition
Implementation of RNNs for classification of a sequence of frames with a unique action (i.e. classification many-to-one).

>
The achieved accuracy is
0.47
>

## Temporal action segmentation
Given a full-length video, segment it recognising the different actions (i.e. classification many-to-many).
